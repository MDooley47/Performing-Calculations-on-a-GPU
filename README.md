# Performing-Calculations-on-a-GPU
A Swift project following the documentation for performing calculations on a GPU with Metal. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/basic_tasks_and_concepts/performing_calculations_on_a_gpu

Apple didn't provide any source code in Swift along with their documentation, so this is what I made in Swift while following their Objective C guide.
